# BuildGhost: AI x QA R&D Lab

Prototyping the future of intelligent test automation.

BuildGhost is an open-source R&D initiative exploring the intersection of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Quality Assurance (QA). Our mission is to conceptualize, architect, and build next-generation tools and prototypes that leverage AI to accelerate software testing, enhance quality, and empower QA professionals.

We believe AI can act as a powerful force multiplier, enabling more efficient, effective, and intelligent approaches to automation, test data management, and overall quality strategy. This repository serves as the central hub for our experiments, prototypes, and potentially, future production-ready tools.

Vision

To be a leading space for innovation in AI-driven QA, fostering a community around building practical, impactful solutions that address real-world testing challenges. We aim to move beyond traditional automation limitations by integrating intelligent systems into the core QA workflow.

Current Prototypes & Projects

The projects within this repository represent ongoing exploration and development.

GhostSpeak (Assuming you put GhostSpeak in a subfolder): A voice-controlled AI chat interface exploring AI as an assistive technology. Leverages the Web Speech API and Generative AI to create a hands-free interaction model. (Status: v0.1 - MVP)

(More projects and tools will be added here as they are developed.)

Contributing
