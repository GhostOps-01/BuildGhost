BuildGhost: AI x QA R&D Lab

Prototyping the future of intelligent test automation.

BuildGhost is an open-source R&D initiative exploring the dynamic intersection of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Quality Assurance (QA).

Our Mission: To conceptualize, architect, and build next-generation tools and prototypes that leverage AI to:

Accelerate software testing

Enhance product quality

Empower QA professionals

We believe AI can act as a powerful force multiplier, enabling more efficient, effective, and intelligent approaches to:

Automation Strategies

Test Data Management

Overall Quality Architecture

This repository serves as the central hub for our experiments, prototypes, and potentially, future production-ready tools.

VISION

To be a leading space for innovation in AI-driven QA, fostering a community around building practical, impactful solutions that tackle real-world testing challenges. We aim to move beyond traditional automation limitations by integrating intelligent systems into the core QA workflow.

CURRENT PROTOTYPES & PROJECTS

The projects within this repository represent ongoing exploration and development. Stay tuned for updates!

GhostSpeak (Status: v0.1 - MVP)

What it is: A voice-controlled AI chat interface exploring AI as an assistive technology.

How it works: Leverages the Web Speech API and Generative AI to create a hands-free interaction model.

(Note: Assumes GhostSpeak lives in a subfolder)

(More projects and tools will be added here as they are developed!)
